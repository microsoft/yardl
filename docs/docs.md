## Installation

Yardl is a single executable file. The installation steps are:

1. Head over to the [latest
   release](https://github.com/microsoft/yardl/releases/latest) page.
2. Download the right archive for your platform.
3. Extract the archive and find the `yardl` executable. Copy it to a directory
   in your `PATH` environment variable.

You should now be able to run `yardl --version`.

## C++ Dependencies

In order to compile the C++ code that `yardl` generates, you will need to have a
C++17 (or more recent) compiler and the following dependencies installed:

1. HDF5 with the [C++ API](https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/cpplus_RM/).
2. [xtensor](https://xtensor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
3. If using C++17, Howard Hinnant's
   [date](https://howardhinnant.github.io/date/date.html) library.

If using the [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) package manager, these
can be installed with:

``` bash
conda install -c conda-forge hdf5 xtensor howardhinnant_date
```

Alternatively, you can create a new conda environment with all dependencies and
compilers using an environment.yml like [the one in this
repo](../environment.yml).

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/yardl/main/environment.yml
conda env create -n yardl -f environment.yml
conda activate yardl
```

If using [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/en/index.html), you can use a manifest file
that looks like the one
[here](../smoketest/cpp/vcpkg.JSON).

On macOS, you can use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install the dependencies:

```bash
brew install hdf5 xtensor howard-hinnant-date
```

The `yardl generate` command emits a `CMakeLists.txt` that defines an object
library and the necessary `find_package()` and `target_link_libraries()` calls.
It has been tested to work on Linux with Clang and GCC, on macOS with
Clang, and on Windows with MSVC with vcpkg.

## Quick Start

> **Note**<br>
> Yardl is currently based on YAML. If you are new to YAML, you can get an
> overview [here](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml/).

To get started, create a new empty directory and `cd` into it. Then run:

``` bash
yardl init playground
```

This creates the initial structure and files for our project:

```
$ tree .
.
└── model
    ├── model.yml
    └── _package.yml
```

The Yardl model package is in the `model` directory.

`_package.yml` is the package's manifest.

``` yaml
namespace: Playground

cpp:
  sourcesOutputDir: ../cpp/generated
```

It specifies the package's namespace along with code generation settings. The
`cpp.sourcesOutputDir` property specifies where the generated C++ code should go.

All other `.yml` and `.yaml` files in the directory are assumed to be yardl
model files. The contents of `model.yml` look like this:

```yaml
# This is an example protocol, which is defined as a Header value
# followed by a stream of zero or more Sample values
MyProtocol: !protocol
  sequence:
    header: Header
    samples: !stream
      items: Sample

# Header is a record with a single string field
Header: !record
  fields:
    subject: string

# Sample is a record made up of a datetime and
# a vector of integers
Sample: !record
  fields:
    timestamp: datetime
    data: int*
```

`!protocol`, `!stream` and `!record` are custom YAML tags, which describe the
type of the YAML node that follows.

`MyProtocol` is a protocol, which is a defined sequence of values that can be
written to or read from a file or binary stream (e.g. over a network
connection). This example protocol says that there will be one `Header` value
followed by an unknown number of `Sample`s. `Header` and `Sample` are records.

To generate C++ code for this model, `cd` into the `model` directory and run:

```bash
yardl generate
```

This will generate a number of files in the `sourcesOutputDir` directory:

``` text
$ tree -L 2 --dirsfirst
.
├── binary
│   ├── protocols.cc
│   └── protocols.h
├── hdf5
│   ├── protocols.cc
│   └── protocols.h
├── yardl
│   ├── detail
│   └── yardl.h
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── protocols.cc
├── protocols.h
└── types.h
```

In the root directory, `types.h` contains generated code for named types like
records and enums. `protocols.h` declares abstract protocol readers and writers,
which are the base classes for implementations in `binary/protocols.h` and
`hdf5/protocols.h`. The `yardl/yardl.h` file defines core datatypes like arrays and
dates, and the header files in `yardl/detail/` are included in generated files
but are not intended to be included by consuming code.

Ok, let's write some code! In the parent directory of the generated code, `cpp`,
create `playground.cc` that looks like this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

#include "generated/binary/protocols.h"

int main() {
  std::string filename = "playground.bin";
  std::remove(filename.c_str());

  {
    playground::binary::MyProtocolWriter writer(filename);

    writer.WriteHeader({"123"});

    writer.WriteSamples({std::chrono::system_clock::now(), {1, 2, 3}});
    writer.WriteSamples({std::chrono::system_clock::now(), {4, 5, 6, 7}});

    // signal the end of the samples stream
    writer.EndSamples();
  }

  playground::binary::MyProtocolReader reader(filename);

  playground::Header header;
  reader.ReadHeader(header);

  std::cout << "Read Header.subject: " << header.subject << std::endl;

  playground::Sample sample;
  while (reader.ReadSamples(sample)) {
    std::cout << "Read Sample.data.size(): " << sample.data.size() << std::endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Adjacent to that file, create a `CMakeLists.txt` that looks something like this:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.19)
project(playground)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)

add_executable(playground playground.cc)
target_link_libraries(playground playground_generated)

add_subdirectory(generated)
```

Now let's compile and run this code. Here are the steps on Linux:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
./playground
```

You can inspect the binary file our code produced with:

```bash
hexdump -C playground.bin
```

Note that the binary file contains a JSON representation of the protocol's
schema. This allows code that was not previously aware of this protocol to
deserialize the contents.

In addition to the compact binary format, we can write the protocol out to an
HDF5 file. This requires only a few modifications to our code:

```diff
  #include <iostream>
  #include <string>

- #include "generated/binary/protocols.h"
+ #include "generated/hdf5/protocols.h"

  int main() {
-   std::string filename = "playground.bin";
+   std::string filename = "playground.h5";
    std::remove(filename.c_str());

    {
-      playground::binary::MyProtocolWriter writer(filename);
+      playground::hdf5::MyProtocolWriter writer(filename);

      writer.WriteHeader({"123"});

      writer.WriteSamples({std::chrono::system_clock::now(), {1, 2, 3}});
      writer.WriteSamples({std::chrono::system_clock::now(), {4, 5, 6, 7}});
      writer.EndSamples();
    }

-   playground::binary::MyProtocolReader reader(filename);
+   playground::hdf5::MyProtocolReader reader(filename);

    playground::Header header;
    reader.ReadHeader(header);

    std::cout << "Header.subject: " << header.subject << std::endl;

    playground::Sample sample;
    while (reader.ReadSamples(sample)) {
      std::cout << "Sample.data.size(): " << sample.data.size() << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
  }

```

You can inspect the HDF5 file with HDFView or by running

```bash
h5dump playground.h5
```

## Packages

A package is a directory with a `_package.yml` manifest.

Here is a commented `_package.yml` file:

```yaml
# _package.yml

# The namespace of the package. Required.
namespace: MyNamespace

# settings for C++ code generation
cpp:
  # The directory where generated code will be written.
  # The directory will be created if it does not exist.
  sourcesOutputDir: ../path/relative/to/this/file

  # Whether to generate a CMakeLists.txt file in sourcesOutputDir
  # Default true
  generateCMakeLists: true
```

In the future, this file will be able to reference other packages and specify
options for other languages.

## Yardl Syntax

Yardl model files use YAML syntax and are requires to have either a `.yml` or
`.yaml` file extension.

To efficiently work with yardl, we recommend that you run the following from the
package directory:

```bash
yardl generate --watch
```

This watches the directory for changes and generates code whenever a file is
saved. This allows you to get rapid feedback as you experiment.

Comments placed above top-level types and their fields are captured and added to
the generated code.

`yardl generate` only generates code once the model files in the package have
been validated. It will write out any validation errors to standard error.

### Protocols

As explained in the [quick start](#quick-start), protocols define a sequence of
values, called "steps", that are required to be transmitted, in order. They are
defined like this:

```yaml
MyProtocol: !protocol
sequence:
  a: int
  b: !stream
    items: float
  c: !stream:
    items string
```

In the example, the first step is a single integer named `a`. Following that
will be a stream (named `b`) of zero or more floating-point numbers, and a
stream (named `c`) of strings.

It is an error to attempt to read or write a protocol's steps out of order. In
order to verify that a protocol has been completely written to or read from, you
can call `Close()` on the generated reader or writer instance.

Generated protocol readers have a `CopyTo()` method that allows you to copy the
contents of the protocol to another protocol writer. This makes is easy to, say,
read from an HDF5 file and send the data in the binary format over a network
connection.

### Records

Records have fields and, optionally, [computed fields](#computed-fields). In
generated C++ code, they map to structs.

Fields have a name and can be of any primitive or compound type. For example:

```yaml
MyRecord: !record
  fields:
    myIntField: int
    myStringField: string
```

Records must be declared at the top level and cannot be inlined. For example,
this is not supported:

```yaml
RecordA: !record
  fields:
    recA: !record # NOT SUPPORTED!
      fields:
        a: int
    recB: RecordB # But this is fine.

RecordB: !record
  fields:
    c: int
```

Note that Yardl does not support type inheritance.

### Primitive Types

Yardl has the following primitive types:

| Type             | Comment                                                                 |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `bool`           |                                                                         |
| `int8`           |                                                                         |
| `uint8`          |                                                                         |

| `uint16`         |                                                                         |
| `int32`          |                                                                         |

| `uint32`         |                                                                         |
| `uint`           | Alias of `unit32`                                                       |
| `int64`          |                                                                         |
| `long`           | Alias of `int64`                                                        |
| `uint64`         |                                                                         |
| `ulong`          | Alias of `uint64`                                                       |
| `size`           | Equivalent to `uint64`                                                  |
| `float32`        |                                                                         |
| `float`          | Alias of `float32`                                                      |

| `double`         | Alias of `float64`                                                      |

| `time`           | A number of nanoseconds after midnight                                  |
| `datetime`       | A number of nanoseconds since the epoch                                 |

### Unions

When a value could be one of several types, you can define a union:

```yaml
Rec: !record
  fields:
    intOrFloat: [int, float]
    intOrFloatExpandedForm:
      - int
      - float
    nullableIntOrFloat:
      - null
      - int
      - float
    arrayOfFloatsOrDoubles:
      - float[]
      - double[]
```

The `null` type in the example above means that no value is also a possibility.

The `?` suffix can be appended to a type name as a shorthand to define an
*optional type*, a special case of union. For example, `int?` is the same as
`[null, int]`.

### Enums

Enums can be defined as a list of values:

```yaml
Fruits: !enum
  values:
    - apple
    - banana
    - pear
```

You can optionally specify the underlying type of the enum and give each symbol
an integer value:

```yaml
UInt64Enum: !enum
  base: uint64
  values:
    a: 0x1
    b: 0x2
    c: 20
```

### Vectors

Vectors are one-dimensional arrays. They can optionally have a fixed length. The simple syntax for vectors is `<type>*[length]`.

For example:

```yaml
MyRec: !record
  fields:
    vec1: int*
    vec2: int*10
```

In the example above, `vec1` is a vector of integers of unknown length and `vec2` has length 10. The expanded syntax for vectors is:

```yaml
MyRec: !record
  fields:
    vec1: !vector
      items: int
    vec2: !vector
      items: int
      length: 10
```

In generated C++ code, `vec1` maps to an `std::vector<int>` and `vec2` to an
`std::array<int, 10>`

### Arrays

Arrays tag denotes a multidimensional array. Like vectors, there is a simple syntax and an expanded syntax for declaring them. Both syntaxes are shown in the examples below.

There are three kinds of arrays. They can be of a fixed size:

```yaml
MyRec: !record
  fields:
    fixedNdArray: float[3, 4]
    fixedNdArrayExpandedSyntax: !array
      items: float
      dimensions: [3, 4]
```

Or the size might not be fixed but the number of dimensions is known:

```yaml
MyRec: !record
  fields:
    ndArray: float[,]
    ndArrayExpandedSyntax: !array
      items: float
      dimensions: 2
```

Or finally, the number of dimensions may be unknown as well:

```yaml
MyRec: !record
  fields:
    dynamicNdArray: float[]
    dynamicNdArrayExpandedSyntax: !array
      items: float
```

Dimensions can be given names, which can be used in [computed
field](#computed-fields) expressions.

```yaml
MyRec: !record
  fields:
    fixedNdArray: float[x:3, y:4]
    fixedNdArrayExpandedSyntax: !array
      items: float
      dimensions:
        x: 3
        y: 4
    ndArray: !array
      items: float
      dimensions: [x, y]
    ndArrayExpandedSyntax: !array
      items: float
      dimensions: [x, y]
    ndArrayExpandedSyntaxAlternate: !array
      items: float
      dimensions:
        x:
        y:
```

In the simple syntax, `int[]` means an int array with an unknown number of dimensions, and `int[,]` means an int array with two dimensions. To declare an array with 1 dimension of unknown length, you can either give the dimension a name (`int[x]`) or use parentheses to disambiguate from an empty set of dimensions: `int[()]`.

### Maps

Maps, also known as dictionaries or associative arrays, are an unordered collection of key-value pairs. They are declared like this:

```yaml
MyMap: !map
  keys: string
  values: int
```

They can be declared with the shorthand syntax:

```yaml
MyMap: string->int
```

Keys are required to be scalar primitive types.

In generated C++ code, these are generated as `std::unordered_map`.


### Type Aliases

We've seen records, enums, and protocols defined as top-level, named types, but
any type can be given one or more aliases:

```yaml
FloatArray: float[]

SignedInteger: [int8, int16, int32, int64]

Id: string
Name: string
```

This simply gives another name to a type, so the `Name` type above is no
different from the `string` type.

### Computed Fields

In addition to fields, records can contain computed fields. These are simple expressions
over the record's other (computed) fields.

```yaml
MyRec: !record
  fields:
    arrayField: int[x,y]
  computedFields:
    accessArray: arrayField
    accessArrayElement: arrayField[0, 1]
    accessArrayElementByName: arrayField[x:0, y:1]
    sizeOfArrayField: size(arrayField)
    sizeOfFirstDimension: size(arrayField, 0)
    sizeOfXDimension: size(arrayField, 'x')
```

To work with union types, you need to use a switch expression with type pattern
matching:

```yaml
NamedArray: int[x, y]

MyRec: !record
  fields:
    myUnion: [null, int, NamedArray]
  computedFields:
    myUnionSize:
      !switch myUnion:
        int: 1 # if the union holds an int
        NamedArray arr: size(arr) # if it's a NamedArray. Note the variable declaration.
        _: 0 # all other cases (here it's just null)
```

The following function calls are supported from computed field expressions:

- `size(vector)`: returns the size (length) of the vector
- `size(array)`: returns the total size of the array
- `size(array, integer)`: returns the size of the array's dimension at the given
  index
- `size(array, string)`: returns the size of the array's dimension with the
  given name

- `dimensionIndex(array, string)` returns the index of the dimension with the
  given name

- `dimensionCount(array)` returns the dimension count of the array

### Generics

Yardl supports generic types.

```yaml
Image<T>: T[]

ImageVariant:
  - Image<float>
  - Image<double>
  - Image<complexfloat>
  - Image<complexdouble>

RecordWithImages<T, U>: !record
  fields:
    image1: Image<T>
    image2: Image<U>
```

Note that protocols cannot be generic types, but its steps may be made up of
closed generic types (e.g. `Image<float>`).

## Performance Tips

### Batched Reads and Writes

Generated protocol reader and writer classes have read and write methods for
each step. When a step is a stream, there will also be overloads that read or
write a batch of values as an `std::vector` in one go. For small data types,
using batched reads and writes can make a dramatic difference in throughput,
especially for HDF5 files.

### Use Fixed Data Types When Possible

For HDF5, using variable-length collections (like `!vector` without a length or
`!array` without fixed dimension sizes) has lower throughput than their fixed-sized
counterparts.

## Protocol Schema JSON Reference

A protocol's schema is embedded in a JSON format in both the HDF5 and binary
encodings. This JSON format is informally described here.

> **Warning**<br>
> We might make breaking changes to this format before V1.

The JSON schema is meant to be provide enough information for deserializers to
understand the schema at runtime, and therefore does not contain the comments
that may be in the Yardl, nor does it contain computed fields, since those are
not needed for deserialization.

### References to Primitive Types

Primitive type references are represented by name as a JSON string, e.g.
`"int32"` or `"string"`

### References to Top-Level Types

References to top-level types (records, enums, and aliases) are represented by
their namespaced name as a JSON string, e.g. `"MyNamespace.MyRecord"` or
`"MyNamespace.MyEnum"`.

### Unions

Unions are represented as a JSON array:

```JSON
[
  {
    "label": "int32",
    "type": "int32"
  },
  {
    "label": "float32",
    "type": "float32"
  }
]
```

The `label` field is unique name automatically assigned to each union case,
derived from its type name. The labels are used in the HDF5 format.

If `null` is one of the cases, it is represented by `null` in the JSON as well:

```JSON
[
  null,
  {
    "label": "int32",
    "type": "int32"
  },
  {
    "label": "float32",
    "type": "float32"
  }
]
```

For the special case of an optional type, a label for the non-null case is
omitted and the object is simplified to its `type` value, since the label is not
used.

```JSON
[
  null,
  "int32"
]
```

### Vectors

Vectors have the following representation:

```JSON
{
  "vector": {
    "items": "int32",
    "length": 10
  }
}
```

The `length` field is only present if it is given in the Yardl definition.

### Arrays

A fixed array with dimensions `x` and `y` would look like this:

```JSON
{
  "array": {
    "items": "int32",
    "dimensions": [
      {
        "name": "x",
        "length": 3
      },
      {
        "name": "y",
        "length": 4
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

A non-fixed array with dimensions `x` and `y` would look like the above but
without the `length` field:

```JSON
{
  "array": {
    "items": "int32",
    "dimensions": [
      {
        "name": "x"
      },
      {
        "name": "y"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

A non-fixed array with two unnamed dimensions would look like this:

```JSON
{
  "array": {
    "items": "int32",
    "dimensions": 2
  }
}
```

And finally, an array with an unknown number of dimensions:

```JSON
{
  "array": {
    "items": "int32"
  }
}
```

### Maps

Maps have the following representation:

```JSON
{
  "map": {
    "keys": "string",
    "values": "int32"
  }
}
```

### Streams

Streams in protocols are represented as:

```JSON
{
  "stream": {
    "items": "int32",
  }
}
```

### Enums

Enums are top-level types and cannot be declared inline.

An example enum that looks like this in Yardl:

```yaml
Animals: !enum
  base: uint8
  values: [cat, dog]
```

Is represented in JSON as:

```JSON
{
  "enum": {
    "name": "Animals",
    "base": "uint8",
    "values": [
      {
        "symbol": "cat",
        "value": 0
      },
      {
        "symbol": "dog",
        "value": 1
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The `base` field is only present in the JSON if it is specified in the Yardl.

### Records

Records are top-level types that cannot be declared inline.

An example generic record:

```yaml
MyTuple<T1, T2>: !record
  fields:
    f1: T1
    f2: T2
```

Would look like this:

```JSON
{
  "record": {
    "name": "MyTuple",
    "typeParameters": [
      "T1",
      "T2"
    ],
    "fields": [
      {
        "name": "f1",
        "type": "T1"
      },
      {
        "name": "f2",
        "type": "T2"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Computed fields are omitted from the JSON since they are not used during
deserialization.

### Aliases

A simple type alias:

```yaml
MyString: string
```

Is converted to:

```JSON
{
  "alias": {
    "name": "MyString",
    "type": "string"
  }
}
```

If an alias is generic:

```yaml
MyVector<T> : !vector
  items: T
```

its JSON looks like this:

```JSON
{
  "alias": {
    "name": "MyVector",
    "typeParameters": [
      "T"
    ],
    "type": {
      "vector": {
        "items": "T"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Protocols

A protocol that looks like this in Yardl:

```yaml
MyProtocol : !protocol
  sequence:
    a: string
    b: !stream
      items: double
```

is represented in JSON like this:

```JSON
{
  "name": "MyProtocol",
  "sequence": [
    {
      "name": "a",
      "type": "string"
    },
    {
      "name": "b",
      "type": {
        "stream": {
          "items": "float64"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Top-Level Schema

The JSON that is embedded in the binary or HDF5 format contains the protocol
definition (defined above) and the transitive closure of named types (records,
enums, and aliases) used by the protocol.

```JSON
{
  "protocol": <protocol>,
  "types": [ <type>, ... ]
}
```

## Compact Binary Encoding Reference

> **Warning**<br>
> We might make breaking changes to this format before V1.

The binary format starts with five magic bytes: `0x79 0x61 0x72 0x64 0x6c`
(ASCII 'y' 'a' 'r' 'd' 'l') followed by four bytes containing a little-endian
32-bit integer representing the encoding version number (currently 1). Then the
[protocol schema](#protocol-schema-reference) in JSON format written as a string
in the format described below.

After the schema, the protocol step values are written in order. The sections
below describe how each data type is encoded.

### Booleans

Booleans are encoded as a byte with the value 0 or 1. However, vectors or arrays
of booleans could use a single bit per value in order to save space. This issue
is being tracked [here](https://github.com/microsoft/yardl/issues/19).

### Unsigned Integers

Unsigned integers (`uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32`, `uint64`, and `size`) are
written as variable-width integers, or *varints* (in same way as Protocol
Buffers). The high-order bit of each byte serves as a continuation and indicates
whether more bytes remain. The lower seven bits of each byte are appended as
increasingly significant bits in the resulting value.

This allows smaller values to be encoded in fewer bytes.

Some examples:

| Integer value | First encoded byte | Second encoded byte |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ------------------- |
| 0             | 00000000           |                     |
| 1             | 00000001           |                     |
| 127           | 01111111           |                     |
| 128           | 10000000           | 00000001            |
| 129           | 10000001           | 00000001            |

### Signed integers

Signed integers (`int8`, `int16`, `int32`, and `int64`) are first converted to
unsigned integers using *zig-zag* encoding, and then encoded as unsigned
integers as above.

Because two's complement sets the highest bit of negative numbers, a negative
64-bit integer would always require 10 bytes to be encoded as a varint, making
it a poor choice. Instead of two's complement, zig-zag encoding stores positive
numbers as `2 * n` and negative numbers as `2 * abs(n) + 1`. This way, small
negative values can still be represented with a smaller number of bytes when
encoded as a varint.

Some examples:

| Original value | Encoded value |
| -------------- | ------------- |
| 0              | 0             |
| -1             | 1             |
| 1              | 2             |
| -2             | 3             |
| 2              | 4             |

### Floating-Point Numbers

`float32` and `float64` are written as a little-endian IEEE 754 of byte length
4 and 8, respectively. `complexfloat32` and `complexfloat64` write out first the
real part followed by the imaginary part.

### Strings

For strings, the length of the UTF8-encoded bytes is first written out as an
unsigned varint, followed by the UTF8-encoded bytes.

For example, the string "hello" is encoded as `Ox05 Ox68 Ox65 Ox6c Ox6c Ox6f`.

### Dates, Times, and DateTimes

Dates are written as a signed varint number of days since the epoch.

Times are written an a signed varint number of nanoseconds since midnight.

DateTimes are written as a signed varint number of nanoseconds since the epoch.

### Unions

Unions are written as the 0-based index of the type followed by the
value.

The index is written as an unsigned varint and the value if skipped if the type
is `null`.

Example values for the union `[null, uint, float]`:

| Value           | Encoded Bytes              |
| --------------- | -------------------------- |
| `<null>`        | `0x00`                     |
| 6 (`uint`)      | `0x01 0x06`                |
| 95.72 (`float`) | `0x02 0xa4 0x70 0xbf 0x42` |


### Vectors

If the vector length is not specified in Yardl:

```yaml
!vector
items: int
```

then the format is:

1. The length of the array as an unsigned varint
2. The array values written one after another.

If the length is given, then (1) is omitted.

### Arrays

If the number of array dimensions is not given in the Yardl schema, then the
format is:

1. The number of dimensions as a unsigned varint
2. Each dimension length as an unsigned varint
3. The values of the array in row-major order

If the number of dimensions is given in the schema, (1) is omitted. If the
length of each dimension is specified, (1) and (2) are omitted.

A future version of the binary format may support column-major layout. See
discussion [here](https://github.com/microsoft/yardl/issues/23).

### Maps

The format is:

1. The length of map as an unsigned varint
2. For each entry, the key followed by the value.

### Enums

Enums are written as a varint encoding of the integer value of the enum. Note
that the value is signed if the base type is signed, which is the default case
if the `base` properly is not specified.

### Records

Records are encoded as the concatenation of the value of its fields, in the
order they appear in the schema.

### Streams

Streams are written as one or more blocks. Each block starts with a length as an
unsigned varint followed by that number of values. The last block will have
length 0 and will simply be `0x0`, which signals that the stream is complete.
Only the last block can have length 0.

### Example

Let's work through an example. Here is a sample model:

```yaml
MyProtocol: !protocol
  sequence:
    floatArray: float[2,2]
    points: !stream
      items: Point

Point: !record
  fields:
    x: uint64
    y: int32
```

We will write the values `{1.2, 3.4}, {5.6, 7.8}` as the `floatArray` step, and
5 points with coordinates `{1, 2}`, `{3, 4}`, `{5, 6}`, `{700, 800}`, and
`{800000, -900000}`. The points will be written in two blocks, the first of
length 3, the second of length 2. The C++ to write these values looks like this:

```cpp
writer.WriteFloatArray({{1.2, 3.4}, {5.6, 7.8}});

writer.WritePoints({{1, 2}, {3, 4}, {5, 6}});
writer.WritePoints({{700, 800}, {800000, -900000}});
writer.EndPoints();
```

Now let's look at the binary file. The first section of the file is the header
and schema. It begins with the magic bytes, the binary version, then the schema
as a JSON string. The string is written as its length (304) encoded as an an
unsigned varint followed by 304 chars.

Following the schema string is the `floatArray` value, followed by the `points`
stream, shown below. `floatArray` is made up of four consecutive 32-bit
floating-point values. The `points` stream is made up of blocks with lengths 3, 2,
and 0. The 0-length block indicates the end of the stream, and in this case the
end of the file as well, since there are no more steps in the protocol. Each nonempty
block has `Point`s, each of which is an unsigned varint followed by a signed varint.
